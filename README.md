# Asteroids

1979 Atari game Asteroids using vanilla JavaScript

The game uses ctx variable for canvas created in Markup to display the game scene and the spaceship.
</br>
By using functions and conditional operators, we are able to control spaceship movement and rotation on key pressing.

</br>
Creating moving Asteroids allows us to implement an interesting game logic and align our spaceship so that it won't crash.

By collosion detextion, the ship can detect asteroids and perform an explosion. After the ship explodes, the game resets and it becomes vulnerable from crushing for several seconds.
