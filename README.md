# Asteroids

1979 Atari game Asteroids using vanilla JavaScript

The game uses ctx variable for canvas created in Markup to display the game scene and the spaceship.
</br>
By using functions and conditional operators, we are able to control spaceship movement and rotation on key pressing.
</br>
</br>
Creating moving Asteroids allows us to implement an interesting game logic and align our spaceship so that it won't crash.
</br>
By collision detextion, the ship can detect asteroids and perform an explosion. After the ship explodes, the game resets and it becomes vulnerable from crushing for several seconds.
</br>
Next, the ship will shoot the lasers and with the explosion effect, it will destroy asteroids piece by piece until there's none left.
